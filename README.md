# BayesianRenewalModels.Rpkg
R package wrapper for Julia package `BayesianRenewalModels.jl`, which has been marked private until the relevant papers are submitted for publication. When that happens, more details will be added to this README.

Note that the julia package is linked via submodule, meaning the Julia source code is part of the R package installation.
When cloning a repository, linked submodules are not included unless the `--recurse-submodules` flag is set.
This is handled automatically when installing via `devtools::install_github`.
